"My current method is getting the source (i use tank encyclopaedia just because there's lots of sides-hots on there), resize it to the same as vanilla vehicles, b&w the layer, reduce noise by like 1 or 2, i then place the layer in a folder and add a levels and brightness/contrast adjustment layers above the folder clipping mask it (these are used to get the lighting somewhat flat, the output lvls for levels is 9-195 and the brightness -4 and contrast 30), I then start separating everything, select pieces of the tank and ctrl+alt+j them to separate. Once separated i begin adding effects to each layer (make sure layers are in the correct order, you don't want parts of the tank that should be behind the hull to look like they're on top of it) I add outer glow and gradient, occasionally drop shadow as well for layers i want defined even more. Final steps are the colouring, logos, extra definition and the tracks; for the tracks i add another brightness/contrast layer and increase the brightness depending on the source, not too much but just enough that the tracks are more visible than they usual are in the source, these are the coloured with a hue/saturation layer to a brownish colour that isnt too saturated. Next i colour the hull, this is all done through hue/saturation and changes depending on the colour you're going for and camo obviously all these hue/saturation layers are put above the folder and clip masked . I then make a new blank layer above the folder and draw some black lines into areas i want to be more defined (e.g the line between the turret and hull) this layer is lowered in opacity by about 50% depending. Finally the logo, tanks look boring without extras like their tank number, logos etc and they're also accurate, for these i simply just draw it on in a new layer, text is done using the text tool, no effects are applied and the opacity is lowered until it looks natural."
